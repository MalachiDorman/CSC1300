a. How many cores does your proccessor have?
10

b. What was the computation time when you run the sequential.cpp program?
0.0.85

c. What was the computation time when you run your parallel.cpp program?
0.095 seconds

d. Now, change the number of threads to 1000 in parallel.cpp by changing the 30 to 1000 for the
threads_wanted variable. Then, compile & run the program again. What was the computation time?
2.23 seconds

Now, change the number of threads to 2 in parallel.cpp by changing the 1000 to 2 for the
threads_wanted variable. Then, compile & run the program again. What was the computation time?
0.239 seconds

f. The sample output was created with a computer that has 14 cores. Did you get the same numbers as the
sample output? Why or why not?
No I did not get the same time because my processor only has 10 cores to work in parallel with.
